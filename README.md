### Background

My name is **Yucheng Lu**, and I am originally from Shanghai, China.  I just finished my undergraduate degree in *Wake Forest University* with a major in Psychology. Here is a link to the funny WFU mascot.

### Hobby

During spare time, I like to

* Keep succulent plants
* Watch Japanese animation
* Carve erasers into stamps

Here is a picture of one of the eraser I carved.
